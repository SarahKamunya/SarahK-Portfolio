        <P>
           Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Sarah Kamunya from Nairobi, Kenya. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology.
           I have always been curious about tech and love its evolving nature. </P>
          <p> Currently I am enrolled in a code boot camp in Moringa School to enhance my skills in programming. 
           I choose the web development path and I hope I turn it into a career because, I really love it! I look forward to learn everyday. 
        </P>
